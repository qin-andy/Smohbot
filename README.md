# Smohbot: a content aware image scaling Discord bot
A content aware image manipulation (seam carving) application built from scratch, packaged in a fun and interactive discord bot!
As opposed to scaling or cropping, seam carving identifies and removes the "least important" seams of an image to smartly reduce image size.

### Features
- Implements two interchangeable seam carving strategies, "Backwards energy" and "Forwards energy" mapping
- Accepts image as discord message attachment, performs seam carving, and sends back carved versions
- Specify either flat or percentage scaling as well as carving strategy through text commands
- Supports seam carving along both vertical and horizontal axes

Written as an application algorithm implementation and design skills.
