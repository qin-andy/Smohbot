# Smohbot
A "Seam Carving" content aware image scaling application built from scratch packaged in a fun and accessible discord bot!
As opposed to scaling or cropping, seam carving identifies and removes the "least important" seams of an image to smartly reduce image size.

### User Features

- Accepts images as discord message attachments and sends content aware scaled versions
- Specify either flat or percentage scaling as well as carving strategy through text commands
- Supports seam carving along both vertical and horizontal axes

Written as an applciation algorithm implementation and design skills.
